# Objscale

## Description

This module allows to set the scale/size of GameObjects and Creatures for each individual spawn. (This is a port of the [Objscale TC-Corepatch from Rochet2](https://github.com/Rochet2/TrinityCore/tree/objscale_3.3.5/src/server/scripts/Custom/objscale))

## How to use ingame

#### Creatures

Select/target a Creature and then use the following Command: 

```
npc_scale set X
```

replace X with any positive floatingpoint number

#### GameObjects

* Get the GUID of the wanted Gameobject (e.g walk up to the GameObject and use the Command .gobject near)

* use the following command to set the GameObjects scale: 

  ```
  gob_scale set Y X
  ```

  * Where Y is the GUID of the GameObject which is to be Changed. (the command also accepts the GameObject-Hyperlinks which are generated by the .gobject near command)
  * And X is the scaling factor (use any positive floatingpoint number)
